For faster grading made you and HTML file and an R markdown file
named "Plotting_Assignment_1_for_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.html. 
you can click on the html file for all the graphs and code.
Learned to do this in the reproducing data class.

Or load the "Data Processing File" through source button in RStudio
and then source the plot files to display the graphs. 

Thank you for taking your time to read this.
